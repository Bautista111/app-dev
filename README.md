# My Favorite Movie: **Venom**

I LOVE **Venom** for so many reasons:

- **Interesting Storyline**: From beginning to end, the plot keeps you fascinated.
- **Tone**: I would say the movie has a '90s tone, with adolescent humor and gross-out gags.
- **Tom Hardy's performance**: The film's high point, in my opinion, is Tom Hardy's performance, which I appreciate.

## Key Characters:
- **Eddie Brock**: An investigative journalist who becomes the host of Venom, an alien symbiote that gives him super-human abilities.
- **Venom**: Venom is the result of an alien symbiote merging with a person who harbors resentment toward Peter Parker.
- **Mrs. Chen**: After being saved by Eddie and Venom, who turned vigilantes, Chen befriended the symbiote, helping the duo if necessary.

## Why You Should Watch:
If you enjoy lighthearted tone, funny one-liners, and isolated world that's separate from other superhero movies, you will love all three movies of Venom.
